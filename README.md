# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of analysis

We were tasked by the head of the school district to look over test data based on grade level from 15 different schools. The schools were different on size, spending level per student, total budget, and school type. We were also tasked with cleaning data for the ninth-grade scores of Thomas High School as those were believed to be false scoring data. We completed the analysis and found the following results. 

## Results

•	How is the district summary affected? 
The percent of passing students in reading, math, and overall went down when the data was scrubbed from the ninth-grade of Thomas high. The average scores        remained relatively unchanged.

•	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? 
The ranking for Thomas High School remains unchanged when looked at in comparison to other schools based on scores. 

•	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    
   o	Math and reading scores by grade. 
    This is the only category that is affected by the score change and it only affects the grade nine scores. All other scores per grade level remain unchanged. 
    
   o	Scores by school spending. 
   This remains unchanged.
   
   o	Scores by school size. 
   This remains unchanged.
   
   o	Scores by school type. 
   This remains unchanged.

## Summary and recommendations 

Three changes occurred that are to be expected. The math, reading, and overall passing percentages all went down across the district and inside Thomas High School specifically. The one change that was unexpected is that the average reading score inside Thomas High School actually went up. Removing those scores for the ninth grade actually improved the average for the school. Without knowing the proper scores for that grade it is hard to make a recommendation on what it means, but Thomas High School might want to look at putting some resources into their reading comprehension program for the ninth grade.
